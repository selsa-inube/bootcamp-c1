            which surgically divides their memories between their work and
            personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is
            called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an
            unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature
            of his work… and of himself.

          <p>
            Jason Sudeikis is Ted Lasso, an American football coach hired to
            manage a British soccer team — despite having no experience. But
            what he lacks in knowledge, he makes up for with optimism, underdog
            determination — and biscuits. The widely acclaimed series also stars
            Hannah Waddingham, Brendan Hunt, Jeremy Swift, Juno Temple, Brett
            Goldstein, Phil Dunster, and Nick Mohammed.
          </p>

            with Warner Bros. and Universal Television, a division of Universal
            Studio Group. Doozer’s Jeff Ingold also serves as an executive
            producer, with Liza Katzer as co-executive producer. The series was
